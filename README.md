I have understood from the given assignment is that source is not running because the header file each file importing from header folder is has some error these errors are 
that these file are unable to include   header files like vector,string,stlib etc. According to me we have to include these header file in header folder to make the code work.
I'm unable to figure where I need to make change to make include header files in header folder.
